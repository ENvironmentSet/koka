# Koka: a function-oriented language with effect inference

_Note: Koka v2 is a research language that currently under heavy development with the new evidence translation and C backend -- various
features may be lacking, documentation may be outdated, not all tests will run, and there may be bugs.
Use the branch [`v1-master`](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka/tree/v1-master) to use the older stable Koka v1 with the Javascript backend._

Koka is a strongly typed, strict functional language which tracks the (side) _effects_ of every function in its type.
Koka syntax is Javascript/C like,
the evaluation is strict like OCaml/C, and the type- and effect system is Haskell like, where pure and effectful computations are distinguished.
The precise effect typing gives Koka rock-solid semantics backed by well-studied category theory, which makes Koka particularly easy to reason
about for both humans and compilers. (Given the importance of effect typing, the name Koka was derived from the Japanese word for _effective_ ([Kōka](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C), 効果)).

<img align="right" width="300" src="doc/snippet-rbtree.png"/>

A function without any effect is called _total_ and corresponds to mathematically total functions -- a good place to be.
Then we have effects for partial functions that can raise exceptions, as _exn_, and potentially non-terminating functions as _div_ (divergent).
The combination of _exn_ and _div_ is called _pure_ as that corresponds to Haskell's notion of purity. On top of that we find
mutability (as _st_) up to full non-deterministic side effects in _io_.

Koka also has full support for _algebraic effect handlers_. This enables powerful control-flow abstraction that allows users to define
compositional control-flow abstractions as a library; this includes advanced abstractions like exceptions, iterators, async-await concurrency,
ambient state, backtracking parser combinators, probablistic programming, Bayesian machine learning, etc. Algebraic effect handlers subsume (free)
monads, and are compositional without needing lifting or monad transformers.

Recent work on [evidence translation](#evidence-translation) and [Perceus](#perceus) precise compiler guided reference counting enable Koka to compile directly
to plain C code _without needing a garbage collector_ or runtime system. Initial performance benchmarks are promising (see below),
and it is our goal to generally fall within a factor 2&times; of C++ performance without needing manual memory management.

Special thanks to:
- [Ningning Xie](https://xnning.github.io/): for her work on the theory and practice of [evidence translation](#evidence-translation) for algebraic effect handlers [6].
- [Alex Reinking](https://alexreinking.com/): for the ongoing work on the [Perceus](#perceus) reference counting analysis.
- And all previous interns working on earlier versions of Koka: Daniel Hillerström, Jonathan Brachthäuser, Niki Vazou, Ross Tate, and Edsko de Vries.

Main branches:
- `master`: latest stable version.
- `dev`: current development branch -- submit PR's to this branch.
- `v1-master`: last stable version of Koka v1: this is Koka with the Javascript (and C#) backend which does not use evidence translation.
               This version still supports more features (like named handlers and `std/async`) and should compile examples from published papers.


## Running the compiler

At this point there are no binary releases of Koka and you need to build
the compiler yourself. Fortunately, Koka has few dependencies and should build
without problems on most common platforms, e.g. Windows (including WSL), macOS X, and
Unix.

The following programs are required to build Koka:

* [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) to run the Haskell compiler.  
  (use `> curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh` on Unix and macOS X)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to compile the generated C files.  
  (use `> sudo apt-get install cmake` on Ubuntu, `> brew install cmake` on macOS X).
* Optional: The [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build system for faster build times.  
  (required on Windows, use `> sudo apt-get install ninja-build` on Ubuntu, `> brew install ninja` on macOS X).
* Optional: the [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) runtime if using the Javascript backend.

Building Koka (note the `--recursive` flag):
```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/koka-lang/koka
> cd koka
> stack build
```
You can also use `stack build --fast` to build a debug version of the compiler.
You can invoke the compiler now as: (this takes a while as it needs to build the core libraries as well)
```
> stack exec koka -- -c test/algeff/common
compile: test/algeff/common.kk
loading: std/core
loading: std/core/types
loading: std/core/hnd
check  : test/algeff/common
cmake --build "out\Debug\cbuild" --target test_algeff_common
...
[5/5] Linking C executable test_algeff_common.exe
compiled: out\Debug\test_algeff_common.exe
```
and run the resulting executable:
```
> out\Debug\test_algeff_common.exe
42
Hello there, there
hi
hi
1
2
[False,True,True,False]
([False,False,True,True,False],2)
```
(note: on Windows you may need to run in the stack environment as `> stack exec out\Debug\test_algeff_common.exe`)

If you leave out the `-c` flag, Koka will execute the compiled program automatically.
The `-O2` flag builds an optimized program. Let's try it on a functional implementation
of balanced insertion in a red-black tree balanced ([`rbtree.kk`](test/bench/koka/rbtree.kk))
```
> stack exec koka -- -O2 -c test/bench/koka/rbtree32.kk
...
cmake --build "out/RelWithDebInfo/cbuild" --target test_bench_koka_rbtree32
[15/15] Linking C executable test_bench_koka_rbtree32
compiled: out/RelWithDebInfo/test_bench_koka_rbtree32

> time out/RelWithDebInfo/test_bench_koka_rbtree32
420000
real    0m1.132s
```
We can compare this against an in-place updating C++ implementation using `stl::map`
([`rbtree.cpp`](test/bench/cpp/rbtree.cpp)) (which uses the
[`tree.cc`](https://code.woboq.org/gcc/libstdc++-v3/src/c++98/tree.cc.html) implementation internally):
```
> g++ --std=c++17 -o cpp_rbtree -O3 test/bench/cpp/rbtree.cpp
> time ./cpp_rbtree
420000
real    0m1.096s
...
```
The close performance to C++ here is a result of [Perceus](#perceus) automatically
tranforming the fast path of the pure functional rebalancing to use mostly in-place updates,
closely mimicking the imperative rebalancing code of the hand optimized C++ library.

The [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor is recommended
to edit Koka programs. You can install support for Koka programs in Atom by 
running the `util/atom.kk` script:

`> stack exec koka -- util/atom`


## Running the interactive compiler

Without giving any input files, the interactive interpreter runs by default:
````
> stack exec koka

 _          _           ____
| |        | |         |__  \
| | __ ___ | | __ __ _  __) |
| |/ // _ \| |/ // _` || ___/ welcome to the koka interpreter
|   <| (_) |   <| (_| ||____| version 2.0.1, Oct 24 2020, libc 64-bit
|_|\_\\___/|_|\_\\__,_|       type :? for help

loading: std/core
loading: std/core/types
loading: std/core/hnd

>
````
Now you can test some expressions:

    > println("hi koka")
    loading: std/core
    loading: std/core/types
    loading: std/core/hnd
    check  : interactive
    cmake --build "out\Debug\cbuild" --target interactive
    [2/2] Linking C executable interactive.exe
    compiled: out\Debug\interactive.exe

    hi koka

    > :t "hi"
    string

    > :t println("hi")
    console ()

Or load a demo:

    > :l test/medium/fibonacci
    compile: test/medium/fibonacci.kk
    loading: std/core
    loading: std/core/types
    loading: std/core/hnd
    check  : test/medium/fibonacci
    modules:
      test/medium/fibonacci

    > main()
    cmake --build "out/Debug/cbuild" --target interactive
    [2/2] Linking C executable interactive
    compiled: out/Debug/interactive

    The 10000th fibonacci number is 33644764876431783266621612005107543310302148460680063906564769974680081442166662368155595513633734025582065332680836159373734790483865268263040892463056431887354544369559827491606602099884183933864652731300088830269235673613135117579297437854413752130520504347701602264758318906527890855154366159582987279682987510631200575428783453215515103870818298969791613127856265033195487140214287532698187962046936097879900350962302291026368131493195275630227837628441540360584402572114334961180023091208287046088923962328835461505776583271252546093591128203925285393434620904245248929403901706233888991085841065183173360437470737908552631764325733993712871937587746897479926305837065742830161637408969178426378624212835258112820516370298089332099905707920064367426202389783111470054074998459250360633560933883831923386783056136435351892133279732908133732642652633989763922723407882928177953580570993691049175470808931841056146322338217465637321248226383092103297701648054726243842374862411453093812206564914032751086643394517512161526545361333111314042436854805106765843493523836959653428071768775328348234345557366719731392746273629108210679280784718035329131176778924659089938635459327894523777674406192240337638674004021330343297496902028328145933418826817683893072003634795623117103101291953169794607632737589253530772552375943788434504067715555779056450443016640119462580972216729758615026968443146952034614932291105970676243268515992834709891284706740862008587135016260312071903172086094081298321581077282076353186624611278245537208532365305775956430072517744315051539600905168603220349163222640885248852433158051534849622434848299380905070483482449327453732624567755879089187190803662058009594743150052402532709746995318770724376825907419939632265984147498193609285223945039707165443156421328157688908058783183404917434556270520223564846495196112460268313970975069382648706613264507665074611512677522748621598642530711298441182622661057163515069260029861704945425047491378115154139941550671256271197133252763631939606902895650288268608362241082050562430701794976171121233066073310059947366875

And quit the interpreter:

## Algebraic effect handlers

A novel feature of Koka is a compiled and typed implementation of algebraic
effect handlers (described in detail in [[3]](#references)).
In the interactive environment, you can load various demo files with algebraic
effects which are located in the ``test/algeff`` directory.

    > :f test/algeff/common

where ``:f`` forces a recompile (versus ``:l`` which avoids a recompile if possible).
Use the ``:?`` command to get an overview of all commands. After
loading the ``common`` demo, we can run it directly from the interpreter:

    > :f test/algeff/common
    loading: test/algeff/common
    loading: std/core
    loading: std/core/types
    loading: std/core/hnd
    modules:
      test/algeff/common

    > :t test2    
    () -> console ()

    > test2()
    loading: std/core
    loading: std/core/types
    loading: std/core/hnd
    loading: test/algeff/common
    check  : interactive
    cmake --build "out/Debug/cbuild" --target interactive
    [2/2] Linking C executable interactive
    compiled: out/Debug/interactive

    Hello there, there

Some interesting demos are:

* ``common.kk``: Various examples from the paper "_Algebraic Effects for
  Functional Programming_" [[3]](#references). Shows how to implement
  common control-flow abstractions like exceptions, state, iterators,
  ambiguity, and asynchronous programming.

* ``nim.kk``: Various examples from the paper "_Liberating effects with
  rows and handlers_" [[1]](#references).

# Installing the compiler

The Koka compiler can be installed locally by running the `util/install.kk` script:
```
> stack exec koka -- util/install
```

After installation, you can now directly invoke `koka`:

```
> koka --version
```

compile and run programs:

```
> koka -O2 --showelapsed test/bench/koka/nqueens
...
73712
info: elapsed: 1.395s, user: 1.375s, sys: 0.031s, rss: 96mb
```

or run the interpreter:

```
> koka 
```

## Install on Unix and macOS

Koka is by default installed for the current user in `<prefix>/bin/koka` 
and `<prefix>/lib/koka/v2.x.x`.
On Unix and macOS, the default installation prefix is `~/.local` and it is 
recommended to add `~/.local/bin` to the search path 
(e.g. add `export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`). 

Note: installing to `/usr/local` cannot be done directly as it needs elevated 
privileges. A workaround is to copy the local install afterwards as:
```
> sudo cp -r ~/.local/* /usr/local
```

## Install on Windows

On Windows, the default install is to the userprofile `%APPDATA%\local` which
is usually already on the search path as `stack` is installed there as well.

However, when using `koka` you need to have a C compiler (when
using `stack exec koka` the C compiler supplied with Ghc is used (`mingw`)
but that is not generally available). You can either run `koka` from a 
[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) 
[command prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-enable-a-64-bit-visual-cpp-toolset-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2019)
(and thus use the `msvc` compiler) or install the [`clang`](https://releases.llvm.org) compiler.


# Benchmarks

There is a standard benchmark suite. It is still basic but more benchmarks
with effect handlers are coming. We only test on (Ubuntu) Linux and the benchmarks
need `gcc` (should be there already), and:

- `ghc` (use `sudo apt-get install ghc`), 
- `ocamlopt` (use `sudo apt-get install ocaml`), and
- `swiftc`. The Swift compiler can be downloaded [here](https://swift.org/download/).
   The benchmarks expect `switfc` to be installed at `/opt/swift/bin`,
   so unpack and copy everything under `swift-.../usr` to `/opt/swift/bin`:
   ```
   > tar -xzf swift-5.3-RELEASE-ubuntu20.04.tar.gz
   > cd swift-5.3-RELEASE-ubuntu20.04/usr
   > sudo mkdir /opt/swift
   > sudo cp -r * /opt/swift
   ```

The benchmarks can now be build using:

```
> cd test/bench
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
> cmake --build .
```

We can then run all benchmarks as:
```
> ctest .
```
Or only run benchmarks for one language with `-L <lang>`:
```
> ctest -L koka
```
Or run specific benchmarks using `-R <regex>`,
like the symbolic derivative benchmark:
```
> ctest -R deriv      
Test project /home/daan/dev/koka/test/bench/build
    Start  4: hs-deriv
1/4 Test  #4: hs-deriv .........................   Passed    2.29 sec
    Start 10: kk-deriv
2/4 Test #10: kk-deriv .........................   Passed    1.25 sec
    Start 19: ml-deriv
3/4 Test #19: ml-deriv .........................   Passed    1.73 sec
    Start 25: sw-deriv
4/4 Test #25: sw-deriv .........................   Passed    2.88 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 4
...
```

# Testing

To run tests, use stack:

```
> stack test                                              # All tests
> stack test --test-arguments="--match /parc/"            # One category
> stack test --test-arguments="--mode new"                # Create output files
> stack test --test-arguments="--mode update"             # Update output files
> stack test --test-arguments="--match /parc/ --mode new" # Combined
```

# Environment

## Windows

On Windows, Koka's C backend can compile with the Stack-supplied MinGW compiler.
However, the MinGW runtime libraries are not added to the PATH by default. In
this case, you can prefix any command with `stack exec` (not just those that
Stack itself built). For example, to use Intel VTune to profile a Koka program:

```
stack exec "C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\VTune Profiler 2020\bin64\vtune-gui.exe"
```

# More on Evidence Translation and Perceus

Koka compiles directly to plain C code without needing a garbage collector or runtime system.
There are two crucial ingredients to make this possible: evidence translation and Perceus.

## Evidence translation

As described in the paper _Effect Handlers, Evidently_, Xie _et al._ [6] show how to translate algebraic effect handlers at compilation
time down to pure lambda calculus where all control flow is explicit again. This is done by Koka to remove any dependence on
runtime mechanisms like split-stacks (as in Multi-core OCaml) or C stack copying [7]. Moreover, as the evidence for each handler
is passed down to the call site, all _tail-resumptive_ operations can be executed in-place without needing to do an expensive
yield- and resume. This makes the cost of tail-resumptive operations on effects comparable to a virtual method call.

## Perceus

Even a pure core intermediate language with explicit control flow is not yet good enough to compile to C directly: without manual memory
management functional languages still need a (tracing) garbage collector (like OCaml or Haskell). A well performing concurrent generational
garbage collector is very hard to build and is invasive as it needs to be able to scan the roots and stack. Even the best garbage collectors
still suffer from unpredictable latencies (especially with large live sets) and tend to require (much) more memory than achievable with
manual memory management (as with C/C++ and Rust).

With Koka we took a new approach based on reference counting. The usual wisdom is that  reference counting does not perform well due to various factors but
in Koka we believe we can do better: 1) we know that all inductive and co-inductive datatypes are never cyclic so we can identify potential cycle introducing
datatypes statically (like mutable references, and these are not so often used in mostly functional Koka), 2) again due to the strict type system
we can statically track which values may become shared across threads and avoid expensive atomic operations for the majority of operations, and
finally 3) due to the explicit control-flow we can do deep analysis on variable life times.
In particular, we use aggressive static analysis to insert _precise_ reference count instructions where memory is freed as soon as
it is no longer live (and in particular, we do not hold on to memory based on lexical scope as in almost all reference counting implementations
in the wild, like Swift, Python, C++ `shared_ptr` etc).

_Perceus_  stands for _Precise automatic reference counting with reuse and specialization_: the _reuse_ component transform functional
style pattern matches into _in-place update_ when possible, while _specialization_ specialize the reference counting based on the call sites and
removes most rc operations in the fast path. For example, a simple `map` function:
```koka
fun map( xs : list<a>, f : a -> e b ) : e list<b> {
  match(xs) {
    Cons(x,xx) -> Cons( f(x), map(xx,f) )
    Nil        -> Nil
  }
}
```
will update the list _in place_ (reusing the `Cons` nodes that are matched) if the list happens to be not shared (and makes a copy otherwise).
This dynamically adjust the program from in-place update to persistence and is the main reason why it can approach the performance of
hand-optimized C++ on the red-black tree benchmark.

Talk and paper are coming soon...

# Things to do

The following is the immediate todo list to be completed in the coming months:

- Port all libray modules, in particular `std/text/regex` (using PCRE), `std/os/file`, and `std/async` (using `libuv`).
- Run the full test suite again.
- Remove dependency on `Jakefile` and use `stack` only.
- Support local state inside a handler without needing `mask<local>`.
- Support named effect handlers again.
- Improve syntax for ambient values, functions, and control.
- Improve syntax for applications (now disallows whitespace between the function and arguments).
- Run the Bayesian machine learning program with large parameters.
- Tune code generation better; the output is still too large.

And future projects:

- Implement inline specialization where functions like `map`, `fold` etc get specialized for the function with which they are called.
- Various standard optimizations like case-of-case, join points, case-of-known constructor, etc.
- Borrowing analysis for Perceus.
- Known reference count specialization.
- Improve compilation of local state to use local variables directly (in C).
- Package management of Koka modules.
- Functions with a pattern match in the argument.
